# Bitaxe Hashrate Benchmark

A Python-based benchmarking tool for optimizing Bitaxe mining performance by testing different voltage and frequency combinations while monitoring hashrate, temperature, and power efficiency.

## Features

- Automated benchmarking of different voltage/frequency combinations
- Temperature monitoring and safety cutoffs
- Power efficiency calculations (J/TH)
- Automatic saving of benchmark results
- Graceful shutdown with best settings retention
- Docker support for easy deployment

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Access to a Bitaxe miner on your network
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Installation

### Standard Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrv777/Bitaxe-Hashrate-Benchmark.git
cd Bitaxe-Hashrate-Benchmark
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Docker Installation

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t bitaxe-benchmark .
```

## Usage

### Standard Usage

Run the benchmark tool by providing your Bitaxe's IP address:

```bash
python bitaxe_hashrate_benchmark.py <bitaxe_ip>
```

Optional parameters:
- `-v, --voltage`: Initial voltage in mV (default: 1150)
- `-f, --frequency`: Initial frequency in MHz (default: 500)

Example:
```bash
python bitaxe_hashrate_benchmark.py 192.168.2.29 -v 1175 -f 775
```

### Docker Usage

Run the container with your Bitaxe's IP address:

```bash
docker run --rm bitaxe-benchmark <bitaxe_ip> [options]
```

Example:
```bash
docker run --rm bitaxe-benchmark 192.168.2.26 -v 1200 -f 550
```

## Configuration

The script includes several configurable parameters:

- Maximum chip temperature: 66°C
- Maximum VR temperature: 86°C
- Maximum allowed voltage: 1400mV
- Minimum allowed voltage: 1000mV
- Maximum allowed frequency: 1200MHz
- Maximum power consumption: 40W
- Minimum allowed frequency: 400MHz
- Minimum input voltage: 4800mV
- Maximum input voltage: 5500mV
- Benchmark duration: 10 minutes
- Sample interval: 15 seconds
- **Minimum required samples: 7** (for valid data processing)
- Voltage increment: 20mV
- Frequency increment: 25MHz

## Output

The benchmark results are saved to `bitaxe_benchmark_results_<ip_address>.json`, containing:
- Complete test results for all combinations
- Top 5 performing configurations ranked by hashrate
- Top 5 most efficient configurations ranked by J/TH
- For each configuration:
  - Average hashrate (with outlier removal)
  - Temperature readings (excluding initial warmup period)
  - VR temperature readings (when available)
  - Power efficiency metrics (J/TH)
  - Input voltage measurements
  - Voltage/frequency combinations tested

## Safety Features

- Automatic temperature monitoring with safety cutoff (66°C chip temp)
- Voltage regulator (VR) temperature monitoring with safety cutoff (86°C)
- Input voltage monitoring with minimum threshold (4800mV) and maximum threshold (5500mV)
- Power consumption monitoring with safety cutoff (40W)
- Temperature validation (must be above 5°C)
- Graceful shutdown on interruption (Ctrl+C)
- Automatic reset to best performing settings after benchmarking
- Input validation for safe voltage and frequency ranges
- Hashrate validation to ensure stability
- Protection against invalid system data
- Outlier removal from benchmark results

## Benchmarking Process

The tool follows this process:
1. Starts with user-specified or default voltage/frequency
2. Tests each combination for 20 minutes
3. Validates hashrate is within 8% of theoretical maximum
4. Incrementally adjusts settings:
   - Increases frequency if stable
   - Increases voltage if unstable
   - Stops at thermal or stability limits
5. Records and ranks all successful configurations
6. Automatically applies the best performing stable settings

## Data Processing

The tool implements several data processing techniques to ensure accurate results:
- Removes 3 highest and 3 lowest hashrate readings to eliminate outliers
- Excludes first 6 temperature readings during warmup period
- Validates hashrate is within 6% of theoretical maximum
- Averages power consumption across entire test period
- Monitors VR temperature when available
- Calculates efficiency in Joules per Terahash (J/TH)
